# DBIT-116533-ASSIGN
DBIT(Strathmore University) 'Intro To Programming' Assignment Github Upload. 

**Student Name**: Kariuki, Celestine

**Student No**. : 116533

# Guidelines:
In the repo, the main program is written in the file 'assignment.cpp'.

When you run ``g++ assignment.cpp``, the file successfully compiles, and generates the file 'a.out'.

In order to run the program, you need to run the 'a.out' file by type it out on the command line
i.e ``./a.out`` .

Once you do that, you will be able to see the statements held in memory by the 'String' array container, under the identifier 'statements',
printed out on the command line.

I printed out the output of those statements in the 'output.txt' file, to make it easier for anyone to read the output.
